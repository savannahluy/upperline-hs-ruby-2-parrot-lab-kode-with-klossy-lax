# Happy Parrot - This parrot is so happy. It accepts a 'thing' as its argument and then returns a string where it says how happy it is about the thing!
def happy_parrot(thing)
  "I am so happy about #{thing}!"
end

# Boring Parrot - Write a method for a boring parrot that just returns whatever string you give him as an argument.
def boring_parrot(repeat)
  "I am a boring parrot, i will copy whatever you say, #{repeat}"
end

# Math Parrot - Create a method that accepts two numbers as arguments and adds them together!
def smart_parrot(x, y)
  sum = x.to_i + y.to_i
  "What is #{x} + #{y}? The answer is #{sum}!"
end

# Friendly Parrot - This parrot greets people by returning their name and age (don't forget to pass that information in as arguments).
 def friendly_parrot(name, age)
   "Hello #{name}! You are #{age} years old!"
 end

# Favorites Parrot - Tell this parrot about your three favorite things and he will return "I love <that thing> too!" for each of them.
def favorites_parrot(fav_1, fav_2, fav_3)
   "I love #{fav_3} too!"
end

# Now try calling your methods below with any arguments of your choice and puts them to the screen. Like this:

# call your methods here
puts happy_parrot("waffles")

puts friendly_parrot("Savannah", "14")

puts boring_parrot("truck")

puts smart_parrot("2", "6")

puts favorites_parrot("ice_cream", "cupcakes", "cookies")

# Now let's pretend you are a wizard and you want to place a spell on each of the parrots so that they speak backwards. How would you do that?




# The spell has been broken and everyone is speaking normally again. The parrots are really excited about it though - make them shout in all caps.
